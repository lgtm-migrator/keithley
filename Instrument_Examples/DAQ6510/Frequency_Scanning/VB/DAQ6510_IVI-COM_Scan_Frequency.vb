'       This program is a brief example of how a DAQ6510 user might add
'       a frequency measurement to their programmed scan. Only one channel
'       is defined and we provide two different means for triggering, monitoring
'       and extracting the scan measurement data. 
'
'       This example will work any of the following multiplexer card
'       models: 7700, 7701, 7702, 7703, 7706, 7707, 7708, 7710
