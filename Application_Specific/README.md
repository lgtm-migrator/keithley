# Application Specific Code

This GitHub repository stores application specific code for one or multiple Keithley Instruments products.

## Directory

[comment]: **[Title](./directory)**  

* **[Amp-hour Measurement with DMM6500](./Amp-Hour_Measurement)**  
TSP script for the DMM6500 to measure Amp-hours (charge) or Watt-hours (energy). Written to be run entirely from the front panel.

* **[Battery Simulation](./Battery_Simulation/2281S_Battery_Models)**  
Holds a repository of battery models for the [2281S-20-6 Dynamic Model Battery Simulator](https://www.tek.com/tektronix-and-keithley-dc-power-supplies/2281s).

* **[Custom Thermistor](./Custom_Thermistor)**  
Allows the usage of custom Steinhartâ€“Hart coefficients to compute the temperature of a thermistor.

* **[Ford EMC-CS-2009.1 specification](./Ford%20EMC-CS-2009.1%20specification/)**  
A script that turns the Keithley 2600B or 2650A Series SMUs into Arbitrary Waveform Generators, as referenced and used in the Application Note [Using the Arbitrary Waveform Capabilities of the Series 2600B and Series 2650A System SourceMeter SMU Instruments to Perform Ford EMC Power Cycling Testing](https://www.tek.com/en/documents/application-note/using-the-arbitrary-waveform-capabilities-of-the-series-2600b-and-2650a-to-perform-ford-emc).

* **[Hall Effect Test Suite](./Hall_Effect_Test_Software/)**  
Files to be used with LabVIEW 2018 for controlling a 3765 plug-in card for a 3706A to preform Hall Effect and van der Pauw measurements. A current source (recommend Keithley Model 6221) is also required. Optional picoammeter and nanovoltmeter (recommend Keithley models 6485 or 6487, Keithley model 2182A) can improve your measurements. A stand-alone, containerized version of this software is available [on tek.com](https://www.tek.com/en/search?op=&keywords=Keithley+Hall+Effect+Test+Suite+%28NOT+SUPPORTED%29&sort=&facets=_templatename%3DSoftware%26parsedsoftwaretype%3DApplication) as the last supported version (part Number: KHETS-2.0). If you make future fixes to the software, please make a pull request against this folder and update the .zip file. The .zip file contains the files in this directory.

* **[Increase 4-Wire Resistance Measurement Capability with Common-side Ohms](./Increase_4-Wire_Resistance_Measurement_Capability_with_Common-side_Ohms)**  
C# and Python code examples to target increased 4-wire measurement bandwidth per multiplexer card using the Common-side Ohms functionality. 

* **[Rds(On) of SiC MOSFET](./Rds(On)_of_SiC_MOSFET/)**  
Supplemental TSP code to a series of videos made by Keithley Applications Engineer Andrea Clary using a 2461 High Current Source Measure Unit and a 2450 SMU.
