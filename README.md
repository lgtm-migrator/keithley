# Keithley Instruments 

This GitHub repository stores working and in-progress code examples for Keithley Instruments products. The code and content here is not officially supported unless otherwise stated by a Tektronix employee. It is offered for learning and collaboration purposes.

## Directory

* **[Instrument Examples](./Instrument_Examples)**  
Code examples sorted by instrument, including examples taken from the User's Manuals. This is a good place to start off learning about programming for an instrument.

* **[Application Specific Examples](./Application_Specific)**  
Code in any language for any instrument that fulfills a specific application. These are generally more complex solutions.

* **[Instrument Drivers](./Drivers)**  
Code that makes up a partial or complete instrument driver library for any programming language.

* **[KickStart Template Projects](./KickStart_Template_Projects/)**  
Application specific template projects that can be loaded into [Keithley KickStart software](https://www.tek.com/en/products/keithley/keithley-control-software-bench-instruments/kickstart). 

* **[TTI Apps](./TTI_Apps)**  
TSP&reg; Apps for Touch, Test, Invent&reg; instruments (i.e. Keithley's line of touch screen enabled instruments). These are not traditional TSP scripts.
